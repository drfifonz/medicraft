Running Medicraft Project
=========================

Medicraft is designed to facilitate medical imaging analysis by defining pipelines in configuration files. You can run the project by specifying the necessary parameters and steps in a configuration file.

.. note::

   In this project, the dataset is needed. However, it is private and contains sensitive data. To access this dataset, you must contact the author. Permission will be required for the data to be made available and will be considered on an individual basis.




Configuration Overview
----------------------

The configuration file is divided into several sections:

1. **general**: Contains general settings like image size and model parameters.
2. **data**: Specifies data paths, validation split, and seed for data splitting.
3. **experiment**: Defines the sequence of steps (loop) for training and validation.
4. **output**: Specifies the directory for saving results.

Example Configuration Structure
-------------------------------

Here is an example structure of the configuration file:

```
general:
  total_steps: 50
  image_size: [256,512]
  models:
    unet:
      dim: 64
      dim_mults: [1, 2, 4, 8]
      channels: 1

    diffusion:
      timesteps: 1000

    classifier:
      architecture: resnet34
      pretrained: False

data:
  validation_split: 0.1 / 0.9
  csv_file_path: data/datasets/ophthal_anonym/dataset-splitted.csv
  split_seed: 43

experiment:
  loop:
    - name: train_generator
      diagnosis: reference
      lr: 1e-4
      num_steps: 10
      batch_size: 32
      save_and_sample_every: 2000

    - name: validate
      classification:
        loss_fn: cross_entropy
        epochs: 15
        lr: 1e-4
        batch_size: 32
        train_data_type: real
        train_dataset_dir: data/datasets/ophthal_anonym_classed-stratified/train
        val_dataset_dir: data/datasets/ophthal_anonym_classed-stratified/val
        test_dataset_dir: data/datasets/ophthal_anonym_classed-stratified/test

output:
  results_dir: .results
  copy_results_to: '~OneDrive/.......'
