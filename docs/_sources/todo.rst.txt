Medicraft Further Improvements
------------------------------

Medicraft is an open-source project that aims to simplify medical image analysis through synthetic data generation. By leveraging generative models, Medicraft enables the creation of synthetic medical images for training and evaluating machine learning models. While Medicraft offers a range of features and capabilities, there are several areas where further improvements can be made to enhance its functionality and usability.

We welcome contributions to Medicraft! Here are some areas where we would love your help:

1. **Conditional Generating Images**
    - Implement features to generate images based on specific conditions or criteria to enhance the flexibility of synthetic data generation.

2. **Add UMAP to Pipeline Configuration**
    - Integrate UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) into the pipeline configuration to improve data visualization and dimensionality reduction.

3. **Add More Trackers Options**
    - Extend the existing tracking options beyond Weights & Biases (W&B). Examples include integrating MLflow and other tracking tools to enhance experiment management.

4. **Extend Pipeline Configuration Arguments**
    - Provide additional arguments and options in the pipeline configuration to allow for more detailed and customized setup.

5. **Add More Generating Models and Options**
    - Introduce new models for image generation and provide various options to configure and fine-tune these models.

6. **Add Other Classifiers than ResNet**
    - Incorporate additional classifier models besides ResNet, expanding the variety of models available for medical image classification.

7. **Add More Trackers than W&B**
    - Integrate more tracking tools such as MLflow, enhancing the ability to monitor and manage different experiments efficiently.
